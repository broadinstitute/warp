The WGS "hand curated" 20K intervals were created by splitting the genome into a very large number of shards, running joint genotyping (of some cohort), recording the runtime, and using a custom Picard tool to merge intervals by runtime until 20K approximately equal runtime intervals are derived.  The Picard tool itself is lost to time.

The centromeres were derived from the UCSC table browser "centromeres" table.  Then `bedtools merge` was run with a large `-d` distance argument to create one merged interval per chromosome, i.e. the mergedCentromeres.bed file.  Telomeres are first 10,000 and last 10,000, which are Ns in the reference.

Centromeres and telomeres were subtracted from the original "hand curated" 20K using Picard IntervalListTools with `ACTION=SUBTRACT`.
