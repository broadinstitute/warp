## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Optimus documentation has moved! Read more about the [Optimus Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Optimus_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Optimus summary

Optimus is a pipeline developed by the Data Coordination Platform (DCP) of the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Project](https://data.humancellatlas.org/) that supports processing of any 3' single-cell and single-nuclei expression data generated with the [10x Genomic v2 or v3 assay](https://www.10xgenomics.com/solutions/single-cell/). It is an alignment and transcriptome quantification pipeline that corrects cell barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, corrects Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs), generates an expression matrix in a UMI-aware manner, calculates summary metrics for genes and cells, detects empty droplets, returns read outputs in BAM format, and returns cell gene expression in numpy matrix and Loom file formats.
