## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

snM3C documentation has moved! Read more about the [snM3C Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/snM3C/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

The snM3C workflow processes single-cell methylome and chromatin contact sequencing data. It is an in-progress cloud workflow based on the snM3C pipeline described [here](https://hq-1.gitbook.io/mc/).
