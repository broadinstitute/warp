## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Smart-seq2 Single Sample documentation has moved! Read more about the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Smart-seq2_Single_Sample_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Smart-seq2 Single Sample summary

The Smart-seq2 Single Sample pipeline is designed by the [Data Coordination Platform](https://data.humancellatlas.org/about) of the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) to process single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data generated by [Smart-seq2 assays](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2639). The pipeline is designed to process stranded or unstranded, paired- or single-end, scRNA-seq data from an individual cell (to process multiple cells, see the workflow for [Smart-seq2_Multi Sample](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_multisample/MultiSampleSmartSeq2.wdl) pipeline).
