## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus documentation has moved! Read more about the [Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Smart-seq2_Single_Nucleus_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus summary

The Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Pipeline is designed in collaboration with the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN)](https://biccn.org/) to process single-nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) data generated by [Smart-seq2 assays](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2639). The pipeline is designed to process paired-end snRNAseq data from an individual cell (to process multiple cells, see the workflow for [Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample Pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_nucleus_multisample/MultiSampleSmartSeq2SingleNucleus.wdl)).
