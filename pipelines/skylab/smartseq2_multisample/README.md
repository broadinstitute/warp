## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Smart-seq2 Multi-Sample documentation has moved! Read more about the [Smart-seq2 Multi-Sample Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Smart-seq2_Multi_Sample_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!


### Smart-seq2 Multi-Sample summary

The Smart-seq2 Multi-Sample Pipeline is a wrapper around the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample) pipeline. It is developed by the Data Coordination Platform of the Human Cell Atlas to process single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data generated by Smart-seq2 assays. The workflow processes multiple cells by importing and running the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl) for each individual cell and then merging the resulting Loom output files into a single Loom file.
