## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Multiome documentation has moved! Read more about the [Multiome Pipeline (and the ATAC subworkflow)](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Multiome_Pipeline/) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Multiome summary

Multiome is an open-source, cloud-optimized pipeline developed in collaboration with members of the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) (BICCN and BICAN), including the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/division/brain-science/), [Neuroscience MultiOmic Archive](https://nemoarchive.org/), Kai Zhang ([SnapATAC2](https://kzhang.org/SnapATAC2/index.html)), and Alex Dobin ([STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md)). It supports the processing of 10x 3' single-cell and single-nucleus gene expression (GEX) and ATAC data generated with the [10x Genomics Multiome assay](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression).
