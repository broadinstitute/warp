Added the option "--soloBarcodeReadLength 0" STARsoloFastq task to support alignment in Optimus. This change has no impact on MultiSampleSmartSeq2SingleNucleus

# 1.0.3
2021-09-02 (Date of Last Commit)

* Added a new StarSolo task for Optimus in the StarAlign.wdl. However, the same wdl
  contains other Star tasks that are used in the smartseq2 single nuclei for paired and 
  single stranged fastq files. As a result, the smartseq2 processing is not expected to 
  change.
