## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Slide-seq documentation has moved! Read more about the [Slide-seq Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/SlideSeq_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Slide-seq summary

The [Slide-seq workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/wdl/slideseq/SlideSeq.wdl) is an open-source, cloud-optimized pipeline developed in collaboration with the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network](https://biccn.org/) (BICCN) and the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN). It supports the processing of spatial transcriptomic data generated with the [Slide-seq](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1219) (commercialized as [Curio Seeker](https://curiobioscience.com/product/)) assay.

Overall, the workflow corrects bead barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, generates a count matrix, calculates summary metrics for genes, barcodes, and UMIs, and returns read outputs in BAM format.
