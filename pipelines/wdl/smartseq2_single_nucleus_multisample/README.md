## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample documentation has moved! Read more about the [Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Smart-seq2_Single_Nucleus_Multi_Sample_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!



### Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample summary

The Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample Pipeline is a wrapper around the Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Pipeline. It is designed in collaboration with the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN)](https://biccn.org/) to process single-nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) data generated by [Smart-seq2 assays](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2639). The workflow processes multiple cells by importing and running the [Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Sample workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/wdl/smartseq2_single_nucleus/SmartSeq2SingleNucleus.wdl) for each individual cell and then merging the resulting matrix (Loom format) output files into a single matrix containing intronic and exonic counts as well as quality metrics.
