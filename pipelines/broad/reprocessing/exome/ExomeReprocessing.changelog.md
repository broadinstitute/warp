### Breaking changes to the structure of pipeline inputs. 
* Changes to the inputs included with the dna seq single sample references struct:
    * Removed 'fingerprint_genotypes_file' and 'fingerprint_genotypes_index' from bundle and made these optional pipeline inputs
    * Removed 'haplotype_scatter_count' and 'break_bands_at_multiples_of' from bundle and added these to a separate 'VariantCallingScatterSettings' struct
    * Added 'haplotype_database_file' to the references bundle as a non-optional file
#### Additional changes
* Fixed bug in CramToUnmappedBams.RevertSam where it was not reverting the OA tag
* Updated CramToUnmappedBams to properly use the output_map file to support testing.
* Renamed GermlineSingleSampleReferences to DNASeqSingleSampleReferences
* Updated shared tasks to support the new TargetedSomaticSingleSample pipeline

# 1.4
2020-03-05

* Added 'additional_disk' parameter to accommodate larger samples that have steps that run out of disk.

# 1.3

# 1.2
Adjusted memory parameters to avoid Google's new e2 instances because there are not enough machines to satisfy our production use case.

# 1.1
This update is a result to an update to the ExomeGermlineSingleSample pipeline. 
We are jumping forward several versions of Picard, from version [2.18.27](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/tag/2.18.27) to [2.20.4](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/tag/2.20.4)
