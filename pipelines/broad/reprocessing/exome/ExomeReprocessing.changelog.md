### Breaking changes to the structure of pipeline inputs. 
* Changes to the inputs included with the dna seq single sample references struct:
    * Removed 'fingerprint_genotypes_file' and 'fingerprint_genotypes_index' from bundle and made these optional pipeline inputs
    * Removed 'haplotype_scatter_count' and 'break_bands_at_multiples_of' from bundle and added these to a separate 'VariantCallingScatterSettings' struct
    * Added 'haplotype_database_file' to the references bundle as a non-optional file
#### Additional changes
* Fixed bug in CramToUnmappedBams.RevertSam where it was not reverting the OA tag
* Updated CramToUnmappedBams to properly use the output_map file to support testing.
