* Initial Release of RNAWithUMIs pipeline.
* The RNA with UMIs pipeline is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow created for processing total RNA isolated with the Transcriptome Capture (TCap) method, but can be used to process any bullk RNA-seq data. Overall, the workflow performs UMI correction, aligns reads to the genome, quantifies gene counts, and calculates quality metrics to produces genome- and transcriptome-aligned BAMs, BAIs, and a merged quality metrics file.
