# CheckFingerprint Pipeline

This document describes version 1.0.0 of the CheckFingerprint Pipeline. The CheckFingerprint Pipeline is used internally within the Broad Institute.  It is written in WDL and designed to work on the Cromwell execution engine using Google Cloud Services and Google Cloud Storage as its backend and storage.  

The CheckFingerprint Pipeline is designed to run the Picard tool 'CheckFingerprint' against a supplied input file (VCF, CRAM, BAM or SAM) using a set of 'fingerprint' genotypes. These genotypes can be generated by either pulling them from the (Broad-internal) Mercury Fingerprint Store, or they can be supplied as inputs to the pipeline.

## Modes

The CheckFingerprint Pipeline can operate in different modes (effectively) based on the inputs supplied. These are briefly described here.



## Pipeline Inputs

The CheckFingerprint Pipeline takes the inputs described below. Optional inputs are noted.

### Input Files

*    input_vcf [Optional]. The input (as VCF) to the CheckFingerprint program.
*    input_vcf_index [Optional]. The index file of the input (as VCF).
*    input_bam [Optional]. The input (as CRAM, BAM, or SAM) to the CheckFingerprint program.
*    input_bam_index [Optional]. The index file of the input (as CRAM, BAM, or SAM).
*    input_sample_alias [Optional]. If the input is a VCF (that is, input_vcf is defined) and the VCF contains more than one sample, this parameter lets CheckFingerprint know which sample in the VCF to use.

** NOTE that if neither input_vcf nor input_bam is provided, CheckFingerprint will return the fingerprint as pulled from Mercury, or supplied as input.

### Fingerprint Genotypes
*    read_fingerprint_from_mercury. If true, the CheckFingerprint pipeline will attempt to retrieve fingerprint genotypes from the Mercury Fingerprint Store. If false, an input fingerprint genotypes file (VCF) is required.
*    fingerprint_genotypes_vcf [Optional]. The fingerprint genotypes in a VCF. Required if you are not retrieving fingerprint genotypes from Mercury.
*    fingerprint_genotypes_vcf_index [Optional]. The index of the fingerprint genotypes VCF.
*    sample_lsid [Optional]. The sample lsid used to retrieve the fingerprint genotypes from Mercury. This parameter is required if 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is true.
*    sample_alias. The sample alias for the fingerprint genotypes file. If 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is true this is the value that is put into the fingerprint genotypes file generated when pulling the fingerprints from Mercury. If 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is false AND there is more than one sample in the fingerprint_genotypes_vcf, this parameter lets CheckFingerprint know which sample in the fingerprint_genotypes_vcf to use.

### Reference
*   ref_fasta. The cloud path of the reference FASTA used.
*   ref_fasta_index. The cloud path of the index file for the reference FASTA.
*   ref_fasta_dict. The cloud path of the dictionary file for the reference FASTA.
*   haplotype_database_file. The cloud path of the ‘haplotype_database_file’. This is a file that contains the haplotype block information for the fingerprinting sites.

### Other
*   output_base_name. The base name for the metrics file generated by CheckFingerprint
*   environment [optional].  A string value indicating which environment (dev, or prod) this WDL is to run on. This parameter is required if 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is true.
*   vault_token_path [optional]. The cloud path to the vault token. This parameter is required if 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is true.


## Pipeline Outputs

The pipeline generates the following outputs:

*   fingerprint_read_from_mercury. If the parameter 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is true, the CheckFingerprint pipeline will attempt to read the fingerprint from Mercury using the provided sample_lsid. If the pipeline is successful (the sample lsid is valid and fingerprint genotypes are read from Mercury), then this value will be true.
*   reference_fingerprint_vcf. The fingerprint genotypes VCF. This can be the result of reading the fingerprints from Mercury (if 'read_fingerprint_from_mercury' is true), or the fingerprint_genotypes_vcf that was provided as input. It is possible for this to be undefined if there the pipeline is unable to read fingerprints from Mercury (in which case the output `fingerprint_read_from_mercury' will be false).
*   reference_fingerprint_vcf_index. The index of the fingerprint genottypes VCF.
*   fingerprint_summary_metrics_file. The summary metrics file generated by the CheckFingerprint program. This may be undefined if no fingerprint genotypes are available.
*   fingerprint_detail_metrics_file. The detail metrics file generated by the CheckFingerprint program. This may be undefined if no fingerprint genotypes are available.
*   lod_score. The LOD score as read from the fingerprint_summary_metrics_file. This may be undefined if no fingerprint genotypes are available.
