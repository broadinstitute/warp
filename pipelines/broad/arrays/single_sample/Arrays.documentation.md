# Arrays Pipeline

This document describes version 2.3.5 of the Arrays Pipeline. The Arrays Pipeline is used internally within the Broad Institute.  It is written in WDL and designed to work on the Cromwell execution engine using Google Cloud Services and Google Cloud Storage as its backend and storage.  

The Arrays Pipeline is designed to process Illumina genotyping data (in the form of IDATs) with metadata about the genotyping chip, the sample being processed, and reference information. The pipeline generates several outputs, including an extensively annotated VCF and associated metrics.  The Arrays Pipeline differs from the ‘Illumina Genotyping Array Pipeline’ in that the former calls the latter to do primary analysis, and then uploads the metrics from these analyses to several tables in a cloud database.


## Pipeline Inputs

The Arrays Pipeline takes the inputs described below. Inputs are grouped by functional section. Optional inputs are noted.


*   **Sample-specific**
    *   chip_well_barcode. The unique identifier of the section of the chip on which the sample was run on. This is the concatenation of the chip barcode and the coordinates of the sample on the chip. Example: 7991775143_R01C01
    *   analysis_version. A numeric value that is used to track the number of times the pipeline has been run on this chip_well_barcode.
    *   sample_alias. The name of the sample that was run on the chip segment specified in the chip well barcode above.
    *   sample_lsid.  The lsid of the sample in BSP.  This is used for generating the JSON file of fingerprint genotypes that is to be uploaded to Mercury.
    *   reported_gender. The reported sex/gender of the sample.
    *   red_idat_cloud_path. The cloud path of the red IDAT file.
    *   green_idat_cloud_path. The cloud path of the green IDAT file.
    
    Additional information about the sample from the Mercury LIMS can be passed in the optional params_file or as discrete inputs.

    *   params_file [Optional]. A text file containing information about the sample parameters metadata - as generated by the on-prem pipeline.

    If the params_file is NOT provided, the following inputs are used in its place (and MUST be supplied):

        *   sample_id [Optional]. The ID of the sample as specified by the Mercury LIMS.
        *   collaborator_participant_id [Optional]. The collaborator-supplied name of the participant from which the sample was derived.
        *   participant_id [Optional]. The ID of the participant from which the sample was derived, as specified by the Mercury LIMS.

    *   gender_cluster_file [Optional]. The cloud path of the Illumina gender cluster file (.egt) for the genotyping array to be processed. This optional cluster file is used to run IAAP/gencall specifically for calling the gender of the sample.  It typically is designed with all assays other than those at specific sites on the sex chromosomes zeroed out.
    *   zcall_thresholds_file [Optional]. The cloud path of a thresholds file to be used with zCall. [zCall](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463112/) is a rare variants caller that can be used to improve the calls on rare variant assays on the genotyping array. If this optional parameter is provided, the pipeline will run zCall using the specified thresholds file.

*   **Fingerprinting**
    *   fingerprint_genotypes_vcf_file [Optional]. The cloud path of a VCF containing a ‘fingerprint’ (a set of genotypes - typically generated on an orthogonal genotyping platform - for the sample to be processed). If provided, this file is used by CheckFingerprint to verify that the sample being processed is the same as that reported in the fingerprint_genotypes_file.
    *   fingerprint_genotypes_vcf_index_file [Optional]. The cloud path of the index file for the fingerprint_genotypes_vcf_file
    *   haplotype_database_file. The cloud path of the ‘haplotype_database_file’. This is a file that contains the haplotype block information for the sites used in the fingerprint_genotypes_vcf_file.
    *   variant_rsids_file. The cloud path to the variant_rsids_file. This file contains a list of rsids for fingerprint sites that can be supplied to the pipeline to have it generate a subset of the output VCF containing genotypes only at these sites. This output VCF can then be used as a source of fingerprint information from the sample processed by the pipeline.

*   **Genotype Concordance**
    *   control_sample_vcf_file [Optional]. The cloud path of a VCF containing the genotypes from a control sample. If this file is provided, the pipeline will do a genotype concordance between the VCF of the sample generated by the pipeline and this file.

    *   genotype_concordance_threshold. A numeric value for determining whether a sample with control data passes genotype_concordance.  If the genotype concordance calculated by the pipeline is greater than this value the sample is reported as passing genotype concordance.

    *   disk_size. The default disk size (in GiB) for cloud VMs spun up for the tasks in this pipeline.
    *   premptible_tries. The number of times a task may be preempted by GCE before it is submitted to a non-preemptible VM.
    *   environment.  A string value indicating which environment (dev, staging, or prod) this WDL is to run on.  This value is used in looking up cloud database information.
    *   vault_token_path. The cloud path to the vault token.  This value is used in looking up cloud database information.


## Pipeline Tasks

The pipeline executes the following tasks:

*   UpdateChipWellBarcodeIndex. This task runs a program that loads metadata about the sample and chip into the cloud SQL database.
*   IlluminaGenotypingArray. This task runs the IlluminaGenotypingArray pipeline (another pipeline WDL).
*   GenerateEmptyVariantCallingMetricsFile.  This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task returns an empty GTC file.  This condition typically indicates that normalization has failed.  The task creates a metrics file with minimal information in it, suitable for uploading to the cloud SQL database.
*   UploadEmptyArraysMetrics. This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task returns an empty GTC file. It uploads the empty metrics to the cloud SQL database.
*   BlacklistFailedNormalization. This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task returns an empty GTC file. It creates a record in the blacklist table in the cloud SQL database, indicating that the chip_well_barcode failed normalization.
*   VcfToMercuryFingerprintJson [Optional]. This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task generates a non-empty GTC file.  It takes the fingerprint VCF generated by this task and creates a json file suitable for uploading to Mercury from it.
*   UploadArraysMetrics.  This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task returns a non-empty GTC file.  It uploads array-specific metrics to the cloud SQL database.
*   BlacklistFailedGenotypeConcordance.  This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task returns a non-empty GTC file and if the sample was a control sample and it failed genotype concordance.  It creates a record in the blacklist table in the cloud SQL database, indicating that the chip_well_barcode failed genotype concordance.
*   BlacklistFailedFingerprint.  This task will be run if the IlluminaGenotypingArray task returns a non-empty GTC file and if the sample had an associated fingerprint and it failed fingerprint check.  It creates a record in the blacklist table in the cloud SQL database, indicating that the chip_well_barcode failed fingerprinting.
