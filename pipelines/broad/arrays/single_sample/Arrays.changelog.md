# 2.6.0
2021-11-17

* Updated to Picard 2.26.4
    * Changed GtcToVcf to account for zeroed-out SNPs in the calculation of GTC Call Rate. Previously the GTC Call Rate (which is stored in the VCF header) had been copied directly from the Illumina GTC File. However Illumina's calculation of the GTC Call Rate does not account for (ignore) zeroed-out SNPs, so we recalculate the GTC Call Rate, ignoring zeroed-out SNPs and use this.
    * Fixed a bug in GtcToVcf where 'SOURCE' fields read from the Illumina manifest that contain a semicolon may be incorrectly populated in the INFO field of the VCF.
* Lowered call rate threshold used in autocall to determine if a gender call can be made in order to compensate for Illumina's GTC Call Rate not accounting for zeroed-out SNPs.

## Bug fix, updated documentation
* Update WDL tasks to use latest Picard docker image
    * Bug fix in VcfToAdpc (Allow for null values of Normalized X and Y intensity)  https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1415
* Bug fix in determining autocall gender.  For calling IAAP/gencall with a gender cluster file, we now use an autosomal call rate threshold < 0. This is because IAAP does not calculate gender if the autosomal call rate is below some threshold.  But for Broad gender cluster files, the lab has zeroed out the autosomal SNPs and the autosomal call rate will be 0.
* Update documentation

# 1.0
Initial public release of the Single-sample Arrays pipeline

## Detailed Release Notes

* We have changed from a version of Illumina Autocall shared under NDA to a public Illumina tool called [IAAP](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/iaap-genotyping-cli.html). This resulted in no changes to genotype calls in our tests.
    * The reported version number in the GTC will change.
    * IAAP requires more evidence for gender calling and will report “Unknown” more often than Autocall did.
    * Metrics in the GTC file from IAAP are different from Autocall metrics.
* For chips that are called with zCall, we have removed a filter applied to sites where the zCall-called genotype differs from that of the autocall genotype. Differences can still be found by using other fields in the VCF. This will result in approximately 5% more unfiltered calls on chips that are zCalled (chip dependent).
* Contamination - [VerifyIDIntensity](https://github.com/gjun/verifyIDintensity) is an externally developed tool that we have added to the pipeline. The pipeline outputs a new metrics file regarding the contamination of the sample using the outputs of this tool. 
* Metrics - There are 2 new metrics and renaming of 4 metrics.
    * New
        * `NUM_ASSAYS` - total num of assays on the VCF
        * `NUM_ZEROED_OUT_ASSAYS` - number of zeroed out assays (these are assays that are marked as unusable in the cluster file)
    * Renamed
        * `FILTERED_SNPS' -> 'NUM_FILTERED_ASSAYS`
        * `TOTAL_ASSAYS' -> 'NUM_NON_FILTERED_ASSAYS`
        * `TOTAL_SNPS' -> 'NUM_SNPS`
        * `TOTAL_INDELS' -> 'NUM_INDELS`

The Data Sciences Platform is dedicated to Open Source software and open science. To support this pipeline and that mission, we have Open Sourced the following tools in Picard: 

* [GtcToVcf](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_GtcToVcf.php) - Class to convert a GTC file and a BPM file to a VCF file.
* [MergePedIntoVcf](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_MergePedIntoVcf.php) - Class to take genotype calls from a ped file output from zCall and merge them into a VCF generated by autocall.
* [CollectArraysVariantCallingMetrics](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_CollectArraysVariantCallingMetrics.php) - Collects summary and per-sample metrics about variant calls in a VCF file.
* [VcfToAdpc](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_VcfToAdpc.php) - A simple program to convert a Genotyping Arrays VCF to an ADPC file (Illumina intensity data file).
* [CreateVerifyIdIntensityContaminationMetricsFile](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_CreateVerifyIDIntensityContaminationMetricsFile.php) - A simple program to create a standard picard metrics file from the output of VerifyIDIntensity
