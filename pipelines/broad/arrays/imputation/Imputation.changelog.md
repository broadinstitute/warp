* Initial public release of the Imputation pipeline. Read more in the [Imputation pipeline overview](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Imputation_Pipeline/README).

  * The Imputation pipeline imputes missing genotypes from either a multi-sample VCF or an array of single sample VCFs using a large genomic reference panel. It is based on the Michigan Imputation Server pipeline. Overall, the pipeline filters, phases, and performs imputation on a multi-sample VCF. It outputs the imputed VCF along with key imputation metrics.
