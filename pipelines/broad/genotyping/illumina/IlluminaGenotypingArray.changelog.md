# 1.12.0
2021-11-17

* Updated to Picard 2.26.4
    * Changed GtcToVcf to account for zeroed-out SNPs in the calculation of GTC Call Rate. Previously the GTC Call Rate (which is stored in the VCF header) had been copied directly from the Illumina GTC File. However Illumina's calculation of the GTC Call Rate does not account for (ignore) zeroed-out SNPs, so we recalculate the GTC Call Rate, ignoring zeroed-out SNPs and use this.
    * Fixed a bug in GtcToVcf where 'SOURCE' fields read from the Illumina manifest that contain a semicolon may be incorrectly populated in the INFO field of the VCF.
* Lowered call rate threshold used in autocall to determine if a gender call can be made in order to compensate for Illumina's GTC Call Rate not accounting for zeroed-out SNPs.

# 1.11.7

* Update documentation

# 1.0
Initial public release of the IlluminaGenotypingArray pipeline

## Detailed Release Notes:

The Broad Data Sciences Platform is dedicated to Open Source software and open science. To support this pipeline and that mission, we have Open Sourced the following tools in Picard: 

* [GtcToVcf](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_GtcToVcf.php) - Class to convert a GTC file and a BPM file to a VCF file.
* [MergePedIntoVcf](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_MergePedIntoVcf.php) - Class to take genotype calls from a ped file output from zCall and merge them into a VCF generated by autocall.
* [CollectArraysVariantCallingMetrics](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_CollectArraysVariantCallingMetrics.php) - Collects summary and per-sample metrics about variant calls in a VCF file.
* [VcfToAdpc](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_VcfToAdpc.php) - A simple program to convert a Genotyping Arrays VCF to an ADPC file (Illumina intensity data file).
* [CreateVerifyIdIntensityContaminationMetricsFile](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/picard_arrays_CreateVerifyIDIntensityContaminationMetricsFile.php) - A simple program to create a standard picard metrics file from the output of VerifyIDIntensity
