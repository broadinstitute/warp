## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

Illumina Genotyping Array documentation has moved! Read more about the [Illumina Genotyping Array Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Illumina_Genotyping_Arrays_Pipeline/IlluminaGenotypingArray.documentation) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Illumina Genotyping Array summary

The Illumina Genotyping Array Pipeline was developed by the Broad Pipelines team to process Illumina genotyping array data in the form of IDAT files. Overall, the pipeline performs gender-specific genotyping, sample contamination detection, and summary metric collection. It optionally performs rare variant calling and genotype concordance, creates a fingerprint VCF which can be used for sample verification in parallel processes, and evaluates an existing sample fingerprint to confirm sample identity. The pipeline outputs annotated VCFs, index files, and summary metrics.
