2022-11-04 (Date of Last Commit)

* Updated GATK verison to 4.3.0.0. This includes several bug fixes in HaplotypeCaller.
* Added UG High Quality interval list to single sample random forest filtering
* Changed cutoff QUAL value in GVCF->VCF conversion from 0 to 30. This removes lower quality sites from single sample random forest filtering and from the final VCF since sites that aren't scored by the random forest are removed in ReblockGVCFs.

# 1.0.5
2022-11-08 (Date of Last Commit)

* Removed task MakeOptionalOutputBam in Utilities.wdl, this update makes this pipeline more robust for large samples
* Updated task IngestOutputsToTDR in InternalTasks.wdl with new docker tag to accommodate changes for BroadInternalArrays pipeline. Change has no effect on this pipeline.
* Updated task IngestOutputsToTDR in InternalTasks.wdl with new optional input variable. This update has no effect on this pipeline.
* Updated task FormatArraysOutputs in InternalArrraysTasks.wdl with new docker tag to accommodate changes for BroadInternalArrays pipeline. Change has no effect on this pipeline.
* Removed workspace_bucket workflow parameter from BroadInternalArrays and BroadInternalImputation.

# 1.0.0
2022-05-05 (Date of Last Commit)

* Initial Release of UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermline pipeline.
* The UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermline pipeline is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow created for processing Ultima Genomics Whole Genome Sequenced Germline samples. Overall, the workflow aligns reads to the genome, marks duplicates, calls variants, and calculates quality metrics to produce a CRAM, CRAI, GVCF, filtered VCF, and quality metrics.
