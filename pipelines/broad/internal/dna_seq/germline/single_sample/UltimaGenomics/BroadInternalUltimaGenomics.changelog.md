* Initial Release of UltimaGenomicsWrapper pipeline.
* The UltimaGenomicsWrapper pipeline wraps the UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermline pipeline and performs additional steps that rely on Broad specific infrastructure.
* The UltimaGenomicsWholeGenomeGermline pipeline is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow created for processing Ultima Genomics Whole Genome Sequenced Germline samples. Overall, the workflow aligns reads to the genome, uses HaplotypeCaller to call variants, and calculates quality metrics to produce a CRAM, CRAI, GVCF, filtered VCF, and a merged quality metrics file.
