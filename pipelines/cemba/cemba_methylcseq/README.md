## Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!

CEMBA documentation has moved! Read more about the [CEMBA Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/CEMBA_MethylC_Seq_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### CEMBA summary

CEMBA is a pipeline developed by the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) that supports processing of multiplexed single-nuclei bisulfite sequencing data. It is an alignment and methylated base calling pipeline that trims adaptors, attaches cell barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, filters reads based on quality and creates a VCF with methylation-site coverage.
