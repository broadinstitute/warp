## Announcement: CEMBA is Deprecated 9/12/2024

The CEMBA workflow is now deprecated and will no longer be supported. However, the CEMBA documentation is still available. See [CEMBA Pipeline Overview](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/CEMBA_MethylC_Seq_Pipeline/README) on the [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### CEMBA summary

CEMBA is a pipeline developed by the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) that supports processing of multiplexed single-nuclei bisulfite sequencing data. It is an alignment and methylated base calling pipeline that trims adaptors, attaches cell barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, filters reads based on quality and creates a VCF with methylation-site coverage.
