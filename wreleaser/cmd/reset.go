// resetCmd represents the reset command
var resetCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "reset",
	Short: "Clear the directory which caches WARP releases",
	Long: `'reset' command clears the directory of cached WARP releases

Usage example:

        'wreleaser reset' (clear the default cache located at $HOME/.wreleaser/cache.json)

        'wreleaser reset --cachedir=/path/to/custom' (clear the custom cache located at /path/to/custom)`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("reset called")
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(resetCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// resetCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// resetCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
