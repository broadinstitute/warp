The Exome Germline Single Sample pipeline implements data pre-processing and initial variant calling according to the GATK Best Practices for germline SNP and Indel discovery in human exome sequencing data. 

For a broad overview of the pipeline processes, read the GATK Best Practices documentation for [data pre-processing](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535912) and for [germline short variant discovery](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932).

## Set-up

### Workflow Installation and Requirements

The Exome Germline Single Sample workflow is written in the Workflow Description Language WDL and can be downloaded by cloning the GitHub repository dsde-pipelines. The workflow can be deployed using [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell), a GA4GH compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms. For the latest workflow version and release notes, please see the Exome Germline Single Sample [changelog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/single_sample/exome/ExomeGermlineSingleSample.changelog.md).

### Input Requirements and Expectations

- Human exome sequencing data in unmapped BAM (uBAM) format
- One or more read groups, one per uBAM file, all belonging to a single sample (SM)
- Input uBAM files must additionally comply with the following requirements:
    * Filenames all have the same suffix (we use ".unmapped.bam")
    * Files must pass validation by ValidateSamFile
    * Reads are provided in query-sorted order
    * All reads must have an RG tag
- GVCF output names must end in ".g.vcf.gz"
- Reference genome must be Hg38 with ALT contigs
- Unique exome calling, target, and bait [.interval_list](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531852) obtained from the sequencing provider. Generally the calling, target, and bait files will not be the same.


## Workflow Tasks and Tools

The Exome Germline Single Sample [workflow](ExomeGermlineSingleSample.wdl) imports a series of tasks from the WARP [tasks library](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/develop/tasks/broad) and a DNASeq struct ([DNASeqStructs.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/structs/dna_seq/DNASeqStructs.wdl)) containing reference files from the [structs library](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/develop/structs/dna_seq).

You can read more about the software tools implemented in these tasks by reading the GATK [data pre-processing](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535912) and [germline short variant discovery](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932) documentation.

## Workflow Outputs

- CRAM, CRAM index, and CRAM MD5
- GVCF and its GVCF index
- BQSR report
- Summary metrics; to read more about any particular metric, you can search the metric using the [GATK documentation search](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/categories/360002302312)

## Important Notes

- Runtime parameters are optimized for Broad's Google Cloud Platform implementation.
- For help running workflows on the Google Cloud Platform or locally please
view the following tutorial [(How to) Execute Workflows from the gatk-workflows Git Organization](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035530952).
- Please visit the [GATK Technical Documentation](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/categories/360002310591) site for further documentation on our workflows and tools.
