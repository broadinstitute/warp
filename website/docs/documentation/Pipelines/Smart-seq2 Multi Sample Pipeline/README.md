# Smart-seq2 Multi Sample Pipeline
## Introduction
The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample pipeline is a wrapper around the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample) pipeline. It is developed by the Data Coordination Platform of the Human Cell Atlas to process single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data generated by Smart-seq2 assays. The workflow processes multiple cells by importing and running the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl) for each individual cell and then merging the resulting Loom output files into a single Loom file. 

Full details about the Smart-seq2 pipeline can be read in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample documentation](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample) in GitHub. 

The Multi Sample Smart-seq2 workflow can also be run in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio), a cloud-based analysis platform. The Terra [Smart-seq2 public workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/featured-workspaces-hca/HCA%20Smart-seq2%20Multi%20Sample%20Pipeline) contains the Smart-seq2 workflow, workflow configurations, required reference data and other inputs, and example testing data.

## Inputs 

There are two example configuration (JSON) files available for testing the Multi Sample workflow. Both examples are also preloaded in the Terra [Smart-seq2 public workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/featured-workspaces-hca/HCA%20Smart-seq2%20Multi%20Sample%20Pipeline). 
* [human_single_example.json](human_single_example.json): Configurations for an example single-end human dataset consisting of two samples (cells)
* [mouse_paired_example.json](mouse_paired_example.json): Configurations for an example paired-end mouse dataset consisting of two samples (cells)


### Sample Data Input
The sample data inputs are similar to those specified in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md). The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample workflow processes both single- and paired-end samples; however, these samples can not be mixed in the same run. 
For the Multi Sample workflow, FASTQ files must be located in a cloud-accessible folder and named with the following convention:

*  sample_filename_prefix\_1.fastq (forward reads for paired-end samples or reads for single-end samples)
*  sample_filename_prefix\_2.fastq (reverse reads for paired-end samples and not applicable to single-end samples)

The Multi Sample workflow does not require a list of all FASTQ files; instead, it accepts a list (array of strings) of each sample's filename prefix. Additionally, the workflow accepts the URL for the FASTQ folder location as a string (see table below for details). Then, the workflow uses the filename prefixes and the URL string to find the appropriate input files and run subsequent analyses.


### Additional Input
The reference inputs are identical to those specified in the "Additional Reference Inputs" section of the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md). 

In addition to the Smart-seq2 Single Sample inputs, the Multi Sample workflow has the following inputs:

| Input name | Input Description | Input Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file_prefix | The URL path to the FASTQ file folder | String | 
| input_ids | Array of filename prefixes; workflow will append with \_1.fastq.gz and \_2.fastq.gz | Array of Strings |
| bacth_id | Identifier for the batch of multiple samples | String |
| batch_name | Optional string to describe the batch or biological sample | String |

 
 ## Smart-seq2 Multi Sample Task Summary
 The Smart-seq2 Multi Sample pipeline calls three tasks:
 
 1) [SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl): a task that runs the Smart-seq2 Single Sample workflow
 2) [SmartSeq2PlateAggregation.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/SmartSeq2PlateAggregation.wdl): the wrapper pipeline that checks the inputs, initiates per cell processing and aggregates the results
 3) [LoomUtils.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/LoomUtils.wdl): a task that produces the Loom file output

 
 ## Outputs
 
 The following table lists the outputs of the Smart-seq2 Multi Sample workflow.
 
 | Output file name | Output Description | Output Type |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | bam_files | An array of genome-aligned BAM files (one for each sample) generated with HISAT2  | Array |
 | bam_index_files |  An array of BAM index files generated with HISAT2 | Array |
 | loom_output | A single Loom file  | File |
 
The Loom file is an aggregate of all the individual Loom files generated using the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/SmartSeq2SingleSample.wdl). The aggregated Loom filename contains the `plateid` prefix, which is set by default to the `batch_id` string specified in the input. The `plateid` is also set as a global attribute in the Loom.
 
 Both the individual sample Loom files and individual BAM files are described in the [Smart-seq2 Single Sample README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_sample/README.md).

| Zarr Array Deprecation Notice June 2020 |
| --- |
| Please note that we have deprecated the previously used Zarr array output. The pipeline now uses the Loom file format as the default output. |
