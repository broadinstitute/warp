# What tags are included in an Optimus BAM file?

The Optimus Pipeline outputs a barcoded BAM file of aligned reads. There are multiple tags within the BAM file, including standard tags from [10X genomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/bam) and [Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf). The table below details the tags used by the Optimus Pipeline and the relevant sources/tools from which the pipeline obtains the tags.
