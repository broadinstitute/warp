# Optimus Count Matrix Overview

:::warning
The Loom matrix is deprecated and the default matrix is now h5ad.
:::

The Optimus pipeline's default count matrix output is a h5ad file generated using [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

It contains the raw, but UMI-corrected cell by gene counts, which vary depending on the workflow's `counting_mode` and `count_exons` parameters. If running single-cell data (`counting_mode` is `sc_rna`), the counts will include only exonic gene counts. If running single-nucleus data (`counting_mode` is `sn_rna`), the counts will be whole transcript counts. Additionally, if `count_exons` is set to `true` in `sn_rna` mode, the h5ad will contain the whole transcript counts as well as an additional layer with exonic counts.

You can determine which type of counts are in the h5ad file by looking at the unstructured metadata (the `anndata.uns` property of the matrix) `expression_data_type` key (see [Table 1](#table-1-global-attributes) below).

The matrix also contains multiple metrics for both individual cells (the `anndata.obs` property of the matrix; [Table 2](#table-2-cell-metrics)) and individual genes (the `anndata.var` property of the matrix; [Table 3](#table-3-gene-metrics)). 

:::tip Additional Matrix Processing for Consortia
Previous Loom files generated by Optimus for consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) or the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), may have additional processing steps. Read the [Consortia Processing Overview](consortia-processing.md#hca-data-coordination-platform-matrix-processing) for details on consortia-specific matrix changes.

## Table 1. Global attributes

The global attributes (unstuctured metadata) in the h5ad apply to the whole file, not any specific part. 

| Attribute | Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| `expression_data_type` | String describing if the pipeline counts exonic or whole transcript (exonic and intronic) reads. For the single-cell mode (`counting_mode = sc_rna`), the value will be `exonic`; for the single-nucleus mode (`counting_mode = sn_rna`), the value will be `whole_transcript`. |
| `input_id` | The sample or cell ID listed in the pipeline configuration file. This can be any string, but we recommend it be consistent with any sample metadata. |
| `input_name` | Optional string that can be used to further describe the input. |
| `input_id_metadata_field` | Optional string that describes, when applicable, the metadata field containing the `input_id`. |
| `input_name_metadata_field` | Optional string that describes, when applicable, the metadata field containing the `input_name`. |
| `pipeline_version` | String describing the version of the Optimus pipeline run on the data. |

## Table 2. Cell metrics

| Cell Metrics | Program |Details             |
|:---|:---:|:--------------------|
|`CellID` | [TagSort](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools/tree/develop/tools/TagSort) | The unique identifier for each cell based on cell barcodes (sequences used to identify unique cells); identical to `cell_names`. Learn more about cell barcodes in the [Definitions](#definitions) section below. |
|`cell_names` |  [TagSort](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools/tree/develop/tools/TagSort) | The unique identifier for each cell based on cell barcodes; identical to `CellID`. |
| `input_id` | Provided as pipeline input | The sample or cell ID listed in the pipeline configuration file. This can be any string, but we recommend it be consistent with any sample metadata. |
|`n_reads`|[TagSort](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools/tree/develop/tools/TagSort)| The number of reads associated with the cell. Like all metrics, `n_reads` is calculated from the Optimus output BAM file. Prior to alignment, reads are checked against the whitelist and any within one edit distance (Hamming distance) are corrected. These CB-corrected reads are aligned using STARsolo, where they get further CB correction. For this reason, most reads in the aligned BAM file have both `CB` and `UB` tags. Therefore, `n_reads` represents CB-corrected reads, rather than all reads in the input FASTQ files. |

## Definitions
* Cell Barcode: Short nucleotide sequence used to label and distinguish which reads come from each unique cell, allowing for tracking of many cells simultaneously.
* Fragment: A distinct segment of a read that aligns to a specific location on the reference genome. The [TagSort](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools/tree/develop/tools/TagSort) function defines fragments based on:  1) the presence of a combined `UMI/GX/CB` tag, 2) the reference (Chr1, Chr2, etc.), 3) the nuleotide position, and 4) the strand. While some cells may have more `n_fragments` than `n_reads` (for example, when an RNA read overlaps an exon-exon junction), some barcodes may have fewer fragments than reads (for example, when a cell has multiple reads that overlap).
* Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI): Short nucleotide sequence used to label and distinguish which reads come from each unique transcript present in the cell at the time of lysis, allowing for tracking of many transcripts simultaneously.
