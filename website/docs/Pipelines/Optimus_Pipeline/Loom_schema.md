# Optimus Count Matrix Overview

The Optimus pipeline's default count matrix output is a Loom file, an HDF5 file generated using [Loompy v.3.0.6](http://loompy.org/). 

It contains the raw, but UMI-corrected cell by gene counts, which vary depending on the workflow's `counting_mode` and `count_exons` parameters. If running single-cell data (`counting_mode` is sc_rna), the counts will include only exonic gene counts. If running single-nucleus data (`counting_mode` is sn_rna), the counts will be whole transcript. Additionally, if `count_exons` is set to true in sn_rna mode, the Loom will contain the whole transcript counts as well as an additional layer with exonic counts.

You can determine which type of counts are in the loom by looking at the global attribute `expression_data_type` (see Table 1 below).


The matrix also contains multiple metrics for both individual cells (the columns of the matrix; [Table 2](#table-2-column-attributes-cell-metrics)) and individual genes (the rows of the matrix; [Table 3](#table-3-row-attributes-gene-metrics)). 



:::tip Additional Matrix Processing for Consortia
Loom files generated by Optimus for consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) or the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), may have additional processing steps. Read the [Consortia Processing Overview](consortia-processing.md#hca-data-coordination-platform-matrix-processing) for details on consortia-specific matrix changes.

## Table 1. Global attributes

The global attributes in the Loom apply to the whole file, not any specific part. 

| Attribute | Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| optimus_output_schema_version | String with the loom file spec version |
| expression_data_type | String describing if the pipeline counts exonic or whole transcript (exonic and intronic) reads. For the single-cell mode (counting_mode = sc_rna), the value will be "exonic"; for the single-nucleus mode (counting_mode = sn_rna), the value will be "whole_transcript" |
| input_id | The sample or cell id listed in the pipeline configuration file. This can be any string, but we recommend it be consistent with any sample metadata. |
| input_name | Optional string that can be used to further describe the input |
| input_id_metadata_field | Optional string that describes, when applicable, the metadata field containing the `input_id` |
| input_name_metadata_field | Optional string that describes, when applicable, the metadata field containing the `input_name` |
| pipeline_version | String describing the Optimus version |
