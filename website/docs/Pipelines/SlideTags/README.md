## Introduction to the Slide-tags Pipeline

The **Slide-tags Pipeline** is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow for processing spatial transcriptomics data. It supports data derived from spatially barcoded sequencing technologies, including Slide-tags-based single-molecule profiling. The pipeline processes raw sequencing data into spatially resolved gene expression matrices, ensuring accurate alignment, spatial positioning, and quantification.

This workflow integrates multiple processing steps, including barcode extraction, spatial alignment, transcript counting, and output generation in formats compatible with community tools.

## Slide-tags Pipeline Tasks and Tools

The workflow is composed of several key steps, implemented in separate WDL tasks:

| Task | Tool | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Optimus](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/optimus/Optimus.wdl) | STARsolo | Gene quantification subworkflow that aligns reads to a reference genome and produces a count matrix. Read more in the [Optimus Overview](../Optimus_Pipeline/README.md). | 
| spatial_count | [Custom Julia script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacoskoLab/Macosko-Pipelines/5c74e9e6148102081827625b9ce91ec2b7ba3541/spatial-count/spatial-count.jl) developed by the Macosko lab | Extracts spatial barcodes, performs barcode sequencing error correction, maps reads to spatial barcodes and stores unique (cell, UMI, barcode) triplets in a count matrix, and calculates quality control metrics. Produces an h5 output. |
| positioning | Custom R scripts for developed by the Macosko lab; includes [positioning.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacoskoLab/Macosko-Pipelines/ee005109446f58764509ee47ff51c212ce8dabe3/positioning/positioning.R), [load_matrix.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacoskoLab/Macosko-Pipelines/6a78716aa08a9f2506c06844f7e3fd491b03aa8b/positioning/load_matrix.R), and [run-positioning.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacoskoLab/Macosko-Pipelines/a7fc86abbdd3d46461c500e7d024315d88a97e9a/positioning/run-positioning.R) | Takes in the rna_paths (path to the filtered cell by gene count matrix, UMI counts, and the intronic metrics) to extract cell barcodes, calculates log-transformed UMI counts, and determines mitochondrial gene percentages. Performs data normalization, PCA, clustering, and UMAP embedding for visualization and produces quality metrics and graphs. Assigns cell barcodes to spatial barcode coordinates. |


Each of these tasks utilizes scripts from the [Macosko Lab Pipelines](https://github.com/MacoskoLab/Macosko-Pipelines) repository, modified for streamlined output handling. Dockers for running these scripts are maintained in the warp-tools repository under [slide-tags](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools/tree/develop/3rd-party-tools/slide-tags).

## Outputs

| Output Variable | File Name | Description | Format |
| ------ | --- | ------ | ------ |
| output_file | "output.tar.gz" | TAR file containing compressed CSV of coordinates for each cell and PDFs containing quality control visualizations for clustering and density estimattion. | TAR |
| positioning_log | "positioning.log" | Standard output of the positioning task. | txt |
| sb_counts | "SBcounts.h5" | h5 file containing cell by gene matrix and spatial barcode information. | h5 |
| spatial_log | "spatial-count.log" | Standard output of the spatial barcodes task | text |
