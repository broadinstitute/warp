## Introduction to snm3C

The Single Nucleus Methly-Seq and Chromatin Capture (snm3C) workflow is an open-source, cloud-optimized computational workflow for processing single-nucleus methylome and chromatin contact (snm3C) sequencing data. The workflow is designed to demultiplex and align raw sequencing reads, call chromatin contacts, and generate summary metrics. 

The workflow is developed in collaboration with Hanqing Liu, Wei Tian, Wubin Ding, Huaming Chen, Chongyuan Luo, Jingtian Zhou, and the entire laboratory of Joseph Ecker. Please see the [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgements) section below.

For more information about the snm3C tools and analysis, please see the [YAP documentation](https://hq-1.gitbook.io/mc/) or the cemba_data GitHub repositories created by [Hanqing Liu](https://github.com/lhqing/cemba_data) and [Wubin Ding](https://github.com/DingWB/cemba_data).

## Set-up

### snm3C installation

To download the latest snm3C release, see the release tags prefixed with "snm3C" on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases). All snm3C pipeline releases are documented in the [snm3C changelog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/pipelines/skylab/snm3C/snm3C.changelog.md). 

To discover and search releases, use the WARP command-line tool [Wreleaser](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/wreleaser).

If youâ€™re running a version of the snm3C workflow prior to the latest release, the accompanying documentation for that release may be downloaded with the source code on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases) (see the source code folder `website/docs/Pipelines/snm3C`).

The snm3C workflow can be deployed using [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a GA4GH-compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms. The workflow can also be run in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio), a cloud-based analysis platform. 


### Inputs

The snm3C workflow requires a JSON configuration file specifying the input files and parameters for the analysis. Example configuration files can be found in the snm3C [`test_inputs`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/develop/pipelines/skylab/snm3C/test_inputs) directory in the WARP repository.

#### 1. Demultiplexes reads
In the first step of the pipeline (`Demultiplexing`), raw sequencing reads are demultiplexed by random primer index into cell-level FASTQ files using [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). For more information on barcoding, see the [YAP documentation](https://hq-1.gitbook.io/mc/tech-background/barcoding#two-round-of-barcoding). 

#### 2. Sorts, filters, trims, and aligns paired-end reads, and separates unmapped, uniquely aligned, and multi-aligned reads

**Sorts, filters, and trims reads**
After demultiplexing, the pipeline uses [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to sort, filter, and trim reads in the `hisat-paired-end` task. The R1 and R2 adapter sequences are removed, along with the number of bases specified by the `r1_left_cut`, `r1_right_cut`, `r2_left_cut`, and `r2_right_cut` input parameters. Any reads shorter than the specified `min_read_length` are filtered out in this step.

**Aligns paired-end reads**
Next, the task uses [HISAT-3N](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/hisat-3n/) to perform paired-end read alignment to a reference genome FASTA file (`genome_fa`) and outputs an aligned BAM file. Additionally, the task outputs a stats file and a text file containing the genomic reference version used.

**Separates unmapped, uniquely aligned, and multi-aligned reads**
After paired-end alignment, the task imports a custom python3 script ([hisat3n_general.py](https://github.com/lhqing/cemba_data/blob/788e83cd66f3b556bdfacf3485bed9500d381f23/cemba_data/hisat3n/hisat3n_general.py)) developed by Hanqing Liu. The task calls the script's `separate_unique_and_multi_align_reads()` function to separate unmapped, uniquely aligned, and multi-aligned reads from the HISAT-3N BAM file. Three new files are output from this step of the pipeline: 

1. A FASTQ file that contains the unmapped reads (`unmapped_fastq_tar`)
2. A BAM file that contains the uniquely aligned reads (`unique_bam_tar`)
3. A BAM file that contains the multi-aligned reads (`multi_bam_tar`)

After separating reads, the task imports a custom python3 script ([hisat3n_m3c.py](https://github.com/lhqing/cemba_data/blob/bf6248239074d0423d45a67d83da99250a43e50c/cemba_data/hisat3n/hisat3n_m3c.py)) developed by Hanqing Liu and calls the script's `split_hisat3n_unmapped_reads()` function. This splits the FASTQ file containing the unmapped reads by all possible enzyme cut sites and outputs new R1 and R2 files. 

#### 3. Aligns unmapped, single-end reads and removes overlapping reads
In the next step of the pipeline, the `Hisat_single_end ` task uses [HISAT-3N](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/hisat-3n/) to perform single-end read alignment of the previously unmapped reads to maximize read mapping and outputs a single, aligned BAM file.

After the second alignment step, the task imports a custom python3 script ([hisat3n_m3c.py](https://github.com/lhqing/cemba_data/blob/bf6248239074d0423d45a67d83da99250a43e50c/cemba_data/hisat3n/hisat3n_m3c.py)) developed by Hanqing Liu. The task calls the script's `remove_overlap_read_parts()` function to remove overlapping reads from the BAM file produced during single-end alignment and output another BAM file.

#### 4. Merges mapped reads, calls chromatin contacts, and creates ALLC files

**Merged mapped reads**
The `Merge_sort_analyze` task uses [samtools](https://www.htslib.org/) to merge and sort all of the mapped reads from the paired-end and single-end alignments into a single BAM file. The BAM file is output as both a position-sorted and a name-sorted BAM file.

After merging, the task uses Picard's MarkDuplicates tool to remove duplicate reads from the position-sorted, merged BAM file and output a deduplicated BAM file.

**Calls chromatin contacts**
Next, the pipeline imports a custom python3 script ([hisat3n_m3c.py](https://github.com/lhqing/cemba_data/blob/bf6248239074d0423d45a67d83da99250a43e50c/cemba_data/hisat3n/hisat3n_m3c.py)) developed by Hanqing Liu. The task calls the script's `call_chromatin_contacts()` function to call chromatin contacts from the name-sorted, merged BAM file. If reads are greater than 2,500 base pairs apart, they are considered chromatin contacts. If reads are less than 2,500 base pairs apart, they are considered the same fragment. 

**Creates ALLC files**
After calling chromatin contacts, the task uses the [ALLCools](https://lhqing.github.io/ALLCools/intro.html) `bam-to-allc` function to create an ALLC file from the deduplicated BAM file that contains a list of methylation points. The `num_upstr_bases` and `num_downstr_bases` input parameters are used to define the number of bases upstream and downstream of the C base to include in the ALLC context column.

Next, the task uses the [ALLCools](https://lhqing.github.io/ALLCools/intro.html) `extract-allc` function to extract methylation contexts from the input ALLC file and output a second ALLC file that can be used to generate an [MCDS file](https://github.com/lhqing/allcools_doc/blob/master/tech-background/file-formats.md#mcds-file).

#### 6. Creates summary output file
In the last step of the pipeline, the `summary` task imports a custom python3 script ([summary.py](https://github.com/lhqing/cemba_data/blob/788e83cd66f3b556bdfacf3485bed9500d381f23/cemba_data/hisat3n/summary.py)) developed by Hanqing Liu. The task calls the script's `snm3c_summary()` function to generate a single, summary file for the pipeline in CSV format; contains trimming, mapping, deduplication, chromatin contact, and AllC site statistics. This is the main output of the pipeline.
