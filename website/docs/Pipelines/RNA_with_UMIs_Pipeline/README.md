## Introduction to the RNA with UMIs workflow

The [RNA with UMIs pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/rna_seq/RNAWithUMIsPipeline.wdl) is an open-source, cloud-optimized workflow for processing total RNA isolated with the Transcriptome Capture (TCap) method. TCap is a technique that hybridizes exome baits to cDNA library preparations to better facilitate RNA-sequencing in low-input or poor quality (degraded) samples. These libraries may additionally be prepared with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs), which can help distinguish biological signal from noise resulting from PCR amplification.

Overall, the workflow performs UMI correction, aligns reads to the genome, quantifies gene counts, and calculates quality metrics. The workflow produces genome- and transcriptome-aligned BAMs with indices and quality metrics files. 

While this workflow was created to be used with TCap RNA-seq data, it can be used to process any bulk RNA-seq data.

### References

The pipeline supports both hg19 and hg38 references. The reference set consists of:
1. .fasta, .fai, and .dict files
1. STAR index
1. GTF file (RNASeQC)
1. ribosomal interval list and refFlat file (Picard)

#### FASTA, index, and dictionary files

When running the workflow with the hg38 reference, we recommend using a version without HLA, ALT, and decoy contigs. These non-primary assembly contigs lead to reduced sensitivity unless the mapper is ALT-aware (e.g., bwa-mem). STAR is not ALT-aware, so these contigs should be removed.

In contrast, the hg19 reference does not have nearly as many contigs as the hg38 reference, so the workflow can be run using the standard hg19 reference stored in Broad's [public reference bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/gcp-public-data--broad-references/hg19/v0/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta).

#### GTF file

Genome annotation files (GTFs) contain information about genes, such as the start and end coordinates of each exon, the name of the gene, and the type of the transcript (e.g., protein-coding, antisense). The workflow uses the GENCODE v34 GTF for hg38 and v19 for hg19.

#### Ribosomal interval list and refFlat file

The workflow ribosomal interval list and the refFlat file are used by Picard metrics calculation tools. The workflow uses a custom ribosomal interval list based on the public hg38 ribosomal interval list, which has been modified to include mitochondrial rRNA coding genes. 

#### Additional reference resources

* [Heng Li's blog](https://lh3.github.io/2017/11/13/which-human-reference-genome-to-use) where he argues for removing ALT contigs to improve sensitivity (for both DNA and RNA). 
* [GATK blog post](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360041155232-Reference-Genome-Components) describing the components of a reference genome.

## RNA with UMIs tasks and tools

The [RNA with UMIs workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/rna_seq/RNAWithUMIsPipeline.wdl) imports two additional WDL scripts. The [UMIAwareDuplicateMarking.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/broad/UMIAwareDuplicateMarking.wdl) script is a nested workflow used to mark duplicate sequencing reads, while the [RNAWithUMIsTasks.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/broad/RNAWithUMIsTasks.wdl) script contains individual "tasks" called by the workflow.

Overall, the RNA with UMIs workflow:
1. Converts FASTQs to unmapped BAMs. 
1. Extracts UMIs. 
1. Converts unmapped BAMs to FASTQs and filters reads.
1. Trims adapters and poly(A) tails.
1. Converts FASTQs to unmapped BAMs. 
1. Aligns reads. 
1. Marks duplicate reads and sorts BAMs.
1. Quantifies gene counts. 
1. Calculates RNA and genomic metrics.

The tools each task employs in the RNA with UMIs workflow are detailed in the table below. 

To see specific tool parameters, select the task WDL link in the table; then find the task and view the `command {}` section of the task in the WDL script.

#### 1. Convert FASTQ to uBAM

If paired-end FASTQ files are used as inputs for the pipeline, the first task in the pipeline converts those FASTQ files into an unmapped BAM file using Picard's [FastqToSam](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036510672).

This task is skipped if a read group unmapped BAM file is used as input for the pipeline. 

#### 2. UMI extraction

Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are DNA tags (bases) that identify each DNA molecule before PCR amplification. They enable us to detect whether two reads that align to the same position in the reference are sequences of the same DNA molecule (have the same UMIs; PCR duplicates) or are two separate copies of DNA that happen to have the same sequence (have different UMIs; biological or natural duplicates).

For example, the Illumina sequencers used by the Broad Genomics Platform read 151 bp per read, of which 5 bp are reserved for the UMIs.

The first step of the RNA with UMIs workflow is to use the fgbio's [ExtractUMIsFromBam](http://fulcrumgenomics.github.io/fgbio/tools/latest/ExtractUmisFromBam.html) to remove UMI bases from the reads and store them in the RX read tag. 

The resulting RX tag may contain information like "ACT-GCT." The "ACT" is the 3 bp for read 1 and the "GCT" is the 3 bp for read 2. Even though we reserve 5 bases in a read, we only use 3 bases for UMI; the other two bases are reserved for cell barcode, which the workflow doesn't use.

#### 3. Convert uBAM to FASTQs and filter reads

The [tasks.SamToFastq](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/tasks/broad/RNAWithUMIsTasks.wdl) task uses Picard's [FastqToSam](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036510672) to convert the unmapped BAM to paired-end FASTQ files that can then be used for adapter clipping. This step also removes reads that fail to pass platform/vendor quality checks performed by the sequencing platform and flagged with the corresponding [SAM flag value](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html).

#### 4. Trim adapters and poly(A) tails

After converting the uBAM to FASTQs, the workflow uses [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) to trim sequencing adapters and poly(A) tails from the reads. This task requires an [adapter FASTA file](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/gcp-public-data--broad-references/RNA/resources/Illumina_adapters.fasta;tab=live_object) containing the list of sequences to be trimmed and is publicly available in Broad's [public reference bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcp-public-data--broad-references;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false).

The adapter FASTA file contains the sequences shown below.
```
>Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1
AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA
>Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2
AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT
>polyA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

#### 5. Convert FASTQs to uBAM

The [tasks.FastqToUbam (alias = FastqToUbamAfterClipping)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/broad/RNAWithUMIsTasks.wdl) task converts trimmed FASTQs to an unmapped BAM using Picard's [FastqToSam](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036510672).

#### 6. Alignment with STAR

After UMI extraction, the workflow aligns the paired-end reads to the reference (hg38 or hg19) using the [STAR aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), which is specifically designed for RNA-seq data and can align cDNA sequences with many "gaps" that correspond to introns. 

The task uses the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| outSAMunmapped | Within | Includes unmapped reads in the output file rather than dropping those reads to facilitate potential downstream analysis. | 
| outFilterMismatchNoverLmax | 0.1 | Sets the maximum allowable ratio of mismatches to read length. Reads with a ratio larger than the set value are filtered. For example, for paired-end reads with length 146, the reads are filtered if the number of mismatches is greater than 29 (146 \* 2 \* 0.1 = 29).|
| alignEndsProtrude | 20 ConcordantPair | Allows a maximum of 20 protruding bases at alignment ends and marks these alignments as concordant pairs to prevent reads from small cDNA fragments that were sequenced into adapters from being dropped. This parameter allows for the processing of data derived from low-quality or degraded tissue such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. |

Additional parameters are used to match [ENCODE bulk RNA-seq data standards](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/rna-seq/long-rnas/). To learn more about ENCODE options in STAR, see the [STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf).

After STAR alignment, the workflow outputs both a genome- and transcriptome-aligned BAM.

#### 7. Mark duplicates and sort BAMs

As described in Step 2 (UMI extraction), UMIs are DNA tags that allow us to distinguish between PCR duplicates (duplicate reads with the same UMI) and biological duplicates (duplicate reads with different UMIs).

In this step, the workflow sorts the aligned BAMs coordinates using Picard's [SortSam](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036510732-SortSam-Picard-) tool and then groups the duplicates using UMI-tools' [group](https://umi-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/group.html#) function. Once the duplicates are grouped by UMI, the PCR duplicates are marked using Picard's [MarkDuplicates](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-). This step outputs new genome- and transcriptome-aligned BAM files with PCR duplicates tagged and a corresponding index file.

The transcriptome-aligned BAM is then sorted using GATKâ€™s [PostProcessReadsForRSEM](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/5358861221659-PostProcessReadsForRSEM-BETA-) for compatibility with [RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM). While RSEM is not used in this workflow, it is an additional tool that can be used to quantify expression from RNA-seq data.

#### 8. Gene quantification

After duplicate reads have been tagged, the workflow uses [RNA-SeQC](https://github.com/getzlab/rnaseqc) to quantify the expression level of transcripts based on the number of reads that align to one or more exons of each gene (`rnaseqc2_gene_counts`). Exon-level expression is also quantified based on the number of reads that align to each exon (`rnaseqc2_exon_counts`). 

#### 9. Metric calculation

The pipeline uses [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC),  [RNA-SeQC](https://github.com/getzlab/rnaseqc), Picard's [CollectRNASeqMetrics](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037057492-CollectRnaSeqMetrics-Picard-) and [CollectMultipleMetrics](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037594031-CollectMultipleMetrics-Picard-) tools, and GATK's [GetPileupSummaries](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/4418051471643-GetPileupSummaries) and [CalculateContamination](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/4418054253211-CalculateContamination) tools to calculate summary metrics that can be used to assess the quality of the data each time the pipeline is run. 

If you are a member of the Broad Institute's Genomics Platform using the [internal RNA with UMIs pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/internal/rna_seq/BroadInternalRNAWithUMIs.wdl), there is an additional step that merges the individual metrics files to create the `MergeMetrics.unified_metrics` output file and prepare the data for use in the Terra Data Repository.
