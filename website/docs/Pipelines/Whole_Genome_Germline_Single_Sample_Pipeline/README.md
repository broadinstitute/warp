# Whole Genome Germline Single Sample Overview

| Pipeline Version | Date Updated | Documentation Author | Questions or Feedback |
| :----: | :---: | :----: | :--------------: |
| [WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample_v2.2.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases) | January 6, 2021 | [Elizabeth Kiernan](mailto:ekiernan@broadinstitute.org) | Please file GitHub issues in WARP or contact [Kylee Degatano](mailto:kdegatano@broadinstitute.org) |

The Whole Genome Germline Single Sample pipeline implements data pre-processing and initial variant calling according to the GATK Best Practices (June 2016) for germline SNP and Indel discovery in human whole-genome sequencing data. For a broad overview of the pipeline processes, read the GATK Best Practices documentation for [data pre-processing](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535912) and for [germline short variant discovery](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932).

The pipeline adheres to the Functional Equivalence pipeline specification ([Regier et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06159-4)), a standard set of pipeline parameters to promote data interoperability across a multitude of global research projects and consortia. Read the [specification](https://github.com/CCDG/Pipeline-Standardization/blob/master/PipelineStandard.md) for full details or learn more about functionally equivalent pipelines in [this GATK blog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-docs/blob/master/blog-2012-to-2019/2018-02-09-Batch_effects_begone:_Introducing_the_Functional_Equivalence_data_processing_pipeline_spec.md).

:::tip Want to try the Whole Genome Germline Single Sample pipeline?
You can test the pipeline in Terra! Go the [Whole-Genome-Analysis-Pipeline workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/warp-pipelines/Whole-Genome-Analysis-Pipeline) which includes sample data and workflows for preprocessing and initial variant calling, sample map generation, and joint genotyping.

## Set-up

### Workflow Installation and Requirements

The [Whole Genome Germline Single Sample workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/single_sample/wgs/WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.wdl) is written in the Workflow Description Language [WDL](https://openwdl.org/) and can be downloaded by cloning the [warp repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master) in GitHub. The workflow can be deployed using [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell), a GA4GH compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms. For the latest workflow version and release notes, please see the Whole Genome Germline Single Sample [changelog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/single_sample/wgs/WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.changelog.md).

### Software Version Requirements

* [GATK 4.1.8.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.1.8.0) and GATK 3.5 for Whole Genome Variant Calling
* Picard 2.23.8
* Samtools 1.11
* Python 3.0
* Cromwell version support
    * Successfully tested on v52
    * Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax
* Papi version support
	* Successfully tested on Papi v2

### Input Requirements and Expectations

* Human whole-genome paired-end sequencing data in unmapped BAM (uBAM) format
* One or more read groups, one per uBAM file, all belonging to a single sample (SM)
* Input uBAM files must additionally comply with the following requirements:
    * All filenames have the same suffix (we use ".unmapped.bam")
    * Files pass validation by ValidateSamFile
    * Reads are in query-sorted order
    * All reads have an RG tag
* Reference genome must be Hg38 with ALT contigs

## Workflow Tasks and Tools

The Whole Genome Germline Single Sample [workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/broad/dna_seq/germline/single_sample/wgs/WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.wdl) imports a series of tasks from the [tasks library](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/tasks/broad) and a DNASeq struct ([DNASeqStructs.wdl](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/structs/dna_seq/DNASeqStructs.wdl)) containing reference files from the [structs library](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/structs).

Learn more about the software tools implemented in these tasks by reading the GATK [data pre-processing](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535912) and [germline short variant discovery](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932) documentation.

## Workflow Outputs

* CRAM, CRAM index, and CRAM MD5
* GVCF and its GVCF index
* BQSR report
* Summary metrics; to read more about any particular metric, you can search the metric using the [GATK documentation search](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/categories/360002302312)

### Base quality scores
The final CRAM files have base quality scores binned according to the [Functional Equivalence specification](https://github.com/CCDG/Pipeline-Standardization/blob/master/PipelineStandard.md#base-quality-score-binning-scheme) ([Regier et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06159-4)).

| Original Score | Score after BQSR recalibration |
| --- | --- |
| 1-6 | unchanged |
| 7-12 | 10 |
| 13-22 | 20 |
| 22-infinity | 30 |
