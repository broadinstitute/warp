## Introduction to the Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample pipeline

The Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample (Multi-snSS2) pipeline was developed in collaboration with the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network](https://biccn.org/) (BICCN) to process single-nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) data generated by [Smart-seq2 assays](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2639). The pipeline's workflow is written in WDL, is freely available in the [WARP repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_nucleus_multisample/MultiSampleSmartSeq2SingleNucleus.wdl) on GitHub, and can be run by any compliant WDL runner (e.g. [Crowmell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell)). 

The pipeline is designed to process snRNA-seq data from multiple cells. Overall, the workflow trims paired-end FASTQ files, aligns reads to the genome using a modified GTF, [counts intronic and exonic reads](#6-creating-the-loom-cell-by-gene-matrix), and calculates quality control metrics.

The pipeline has been scientifically validated by the BRAIN Institute. Read more in the [validation section](#validation).

## Set-Up

### Installation

To download the latest release of the Multi-snSS2 pipeline along with example data and dependencies, see the release tags prefixed with "MultiSampleSmartSeq2SingleNucleus" on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases). All releases of the Multi-snSS2 pipeline are documented in the [Multi-snSS2 changelog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_nucleus_multisample/MultiSampleSmartSeq2SingleNucleus.changelog.md).

To search releases of this and other pipelines, use the WARP command-line tool [Wreleaser](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/wreleaser).

The workflow is deployed using [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell), a GA4GH compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms.


### Inputs

There is an [example configuration (JSON) file](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_nucleus_multisample/mouse_example.json) available that you can use to test the Multi-snSS2 workflow. It points to publicly available reference files and sample paired-end FASTQs.

#### Sample data and reference inputs

The table below details the Multi-snSS2 inputs. The pipeline is designed to take in an array of paired-end reads in the form of two FASTQ files per cell. 

* The example mouse reference inputs are created using the [BuildIndices Pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/pipelines/skylab/build_indices).
* The pipeline modifies a given GTF downloaded from GENCODE to only include biotypes that are listed in a tab separated file ([biotypes.tsv](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/dockers/skylab/build-indices/Biotypes.tsv)).
* The example references do not include the pseudogene biotype. Learn more about Ensembl biotypes in the [Ensembl overview](https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html).
* To enable intron counting, the workflow calls a [python script](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/dockers/skylab/build-indices/add-introns-to-gtf.py) to create a custom GTF with intron annotations. Introns are considered any part of a contig that is not exonic nor intergenic.

## Multi-snSS2 tasks and tools

The [Multi-snSS2 workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/smartseq2_single_nucleus_multisample/MultiSampleSmartSeq2SingleNucleus.wdl) imports individual "tasks" (written in WDL script) from the WARP [tasks folder](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/tasks/skylab/).

Overall, the Multi-snSS2 workflow:
1. Trims adapters.
1. Aligns reads.
1. Removes duplicate reads.
1. Calculates metrics.
1. Quantifies gene counts.
1. Merges exon counts, intron counts, and metrics into a Loom-formatted matrix.

The tools each task employs in the Multi-snSS2 workflow are detailed in the table below. 

To see specific tool parameters, select the task WDL link in the table; then view the `command {}` section of the task WDL script. To view or use the exact tool software, see the task's Docker image which is specified in the task WDL `# runtime values` section as `String docker =`.

#### 1. Trimming adapters
The TrimAdapters task uses the adapter list reference file to run the [fastq-mcf](https://github.com/ExpressionAnalysis/ea-utils/tree/master/clipper) tool. This tool identifies the adapters in the input FASTQ files and performs clipping by using a subsampling parameter of 200,000 reads. The task outputs the trimmed FASTQ files which are then used for alignment. 

#### 2. Aligning reads
The StarAlignFastq task runs the STAR aligner on the trimmed FASTQ files. The STAR quantMode parameter is set to GeneCounts, which counts the number of reads per gene while mapping. The task outputs a coordinate-sorted aligned BAM file. 

#### 3. Removing duplicate reads
The RemoveDuplicatesFromBam task removes multi-mapped reads, optical duplicates, and PCR duplicates from the aligned BAM. It then adds readgroup information and creates a new, coordinate-sorted aligned BAM output.

#### 4. Collecting metrics
The CollectMultipleMetrics task uses the Picard tool CollectMultipleMetrics to perform QC on the deduplicated BAM file. These metrics are copied to the final cell-by-gene matrix output (Loom file).

#### 5. Counting genes
The CountAlignments task uses the featureCounts package to count introns and exons. First, the featureCounts tool counts intronic alignments in the deduplicated BAM using a custom GTF with annotated introns. The tool flags intronic alignments if they overlap an annotated intron by a minimum of 3 bp. 

Next, following pipeline processes established by the BICCN Whole Mouse Brain Working Group, a custom Python script (“[remove-reads-on-junctions.py](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/dockers/skylab/featureCounts/remove-reads-on-junctions.py)”) removes all alignments in the deduplicated BAM that cross only one intron-exon junction and produces an intermediate BAM file for exon counting. This removes a negligible amount of putative intronic alignments that did not meet the 3 bp intron overlap criteria. 

Lastly, featureCounts uses the intermediate BAM with junctions removed to count exons. The final outputs of this step include a cell-by-gene matrix of intronic counts, a cell-by-gene matrix of exonic counts, and summary metrics for the different count types.

#### 6. Creating the Loom cell by gene matrix
The LoomUtils task combines the Picard metrics (alignment_summary_metrics, deduplication metrics, and the G/C bias summary metrics) with the featureCount exon and intron counts to create a Loom formatted cell-by-gene count matrix. 

The cell-by-gene matrix can be examined using [Loompy software](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/index.html). Exonic counts are stored in the main Loom matrix which is unnamed by default. They are the default return value of the `loompy.connect()` command. Intronic counts are stored in the Loom as an additional layer which is named `intron_counts`.

You can also access exonic and intronic counts using Loompy's `layers()` method. For example, `loompy.connect.layers[“”]` will return the exonic counts from the output Loom file. Similarly, `loompy.connect.layers[“intron_counts”]` will return the intronic counts from the output Loom. 

Whole gene counts (which include both intronic and exonic counts) can be accessed by adding the intronic and exonic counts together. 

Below is example Loompy code for accessing the Loom's exonic, intronic, and whole gene counts.

```python
import loompy
ds = loompy.connect("/PATH/TO/File.loom")
count_exons = ds[:,:] #geneXcell table for the exonic read counts
count_introns = ds.layer["intron_counts"] #geneXcell table for the intronic read counts
gene_counts = count_exons + count_introns
```

To read more about the Loom file format and use of layers, see the [Loompy documentation](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/index.html).

#### 7. Outputs

The table below details the final outputs of the Multi-snSS2 workflow.  

| Output variable name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| loom_output | Cell-by-gene count matrix that includes the raw exon counts (in matrix), intron counts (in matrix layer), cell metrics (column attributes) and gene IDs (row attributes). | Loom |
| exon_intron_count_files | Array of TXT files (one per cell) that contain intronic and exonic counts. | Array [TXT]| 
| bam_files | Array of genome-aligned BAM files (one for each cell) generated with STAR.  | Array [BAM]|
| pipeline_version_out | Version of the processing pipeline run on this data. | String |

To facilitate downstream analysis, the output Loom file contains both gene names and gene IDs.
