# Consortia Data Processing

## Brain Initiative Cell Census Network Processing
The Smart-seq2 Single Nucleus Multi-Sample (Multi-snSS2) pipeline supports data processing for the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN)](https://biccn.org/). An overview of the BICCN pipeline resources is available on the BICCN's [Pipelines page](https://biccn.org/tools/biccn-pipelines).

### Multi-snSS2 reference files for BICCN data processing
The BICCN 2.0 Whole Mouse Brain Working Group uses the Ensembl GRCm38 reference for alignment and a modified GTF for gene annotation (see table below). All Multi-snSS2 pipeline reference inputs were created with the [BuildIndices workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/pipelines/skylab/build_indices).

 BICCN processes single-nucleus data, which is enriched in pre-mRNAs containing introns. To account for this, the Multi-snSS2 workflow counts reads that map to both exonic and intronic regions (any part of a contig that is not exonic nor intergenic). The BuildIndices workflow uses the `BuildStarSingleNucleus` task to add intron annotations to the GTF with a custom [python script](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/dockers/skylab/snss2-build-indices/add-introns-to-gtf.py). These annotations enable intron counting with the [featureCounts](http://subread.sourceforge.net/) software. 

 The custom GTF contains all annotations for any `gene_id` that has at least one transcript. This reduces the number of genes in the GTF to \~32,000. 

All reference files are available in a public Google bucket (see table below) and are accompanied by a README that details reference provenance (gs://gcp-public-data--broad-references/mm10/v0/README_mm10_singlecell_gencode.txt).
