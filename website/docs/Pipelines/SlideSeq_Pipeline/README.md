## Introduction to the Slide-seq workflow

The [Slide-seq workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/slideseq/SlideSeq.wdl) is an open-source, cloud-optimized pipeline developed in collaboration with the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network](https://biccn.org/) (BICCN) and the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN). It supports the processing of spatial transcriptomic data generated with the [Slide-seq](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1219) (commercialized as [Curio Seeker](https://curiobioscience.com/product/)) assay.

Overall, the workflow corrects bead barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, generates a count matrix, calculates summary metrics for genes, barcodes, and UMIs, and returns read outputs in BAM format.

Slide-seq has been validated for analyzing mouse datasets generated with the Slide-seq assay. Learn more in the [validation section](#validation-against-on-prem-pipeline).

#### Where did the pipeline come from?

The Broad Pipelines Development team worked closely with members of the Evan Macosko Laboratory to adapt an on-premise pipeline into the cloud-based Slide-seq pipeline described here. Thank you to James Webber, Jonah Langlieb, Nina Sachdev, and the rest of the Evan Macosko Lab for their commitment to [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and for helping create the cloud-based Slide-seq pipeline.

## Set-up

### Slide-seq installation

To download the latest Slide-seq release, see the release tags prefixed with "SlideSeq" on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases). All Slide-seq pipeline releases are documented in the [Slide-seq changelog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/slideseq/SlideSeq.changelog.md). 

To search releases of this and other pipelines, use the WARP command-line tool [Wreleaser](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/wreleaser).

If you’re running a Slide-seq workflow version prior to the latest release, the accompanying documentation for that release may be downloaded with the source code on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases) (see the source code folder `website/pipelines/skylab/slideseq`.

The Slide-seq pipeline can be deployed using [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a GA4GH compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms. The workflow can also be run in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio), a cloud-based analysis platform. The [Slide-seq public workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/warp-pipelines/Slide-seq) on Terra contains the Slide-seq workflow, workflow configuration, required reference data and other inputs, and example testing data.

### Inputs

The Slide-seq workflow inputs are specified in JSON configuration files. Example configuration files can be found in the [test_inputs](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/pipelines/skylab/slideseq/test_inputs) folder in the WARP repository.

#### Input descriptions

| Parameter name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  r1_fastq | Array of Read 1 FASTQ files split across multiple sequencing lanes; forward reads containing bead barcodes and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs); order of files must match the `r2_fastq` array. | Array[File] |
| r2_fastq | Array of Read 2 FASTQ files split across multiple sequencing lanes; reverse reads containing the cDNA fragment generated from captured mRNA; order of files must match the `r1_fastq` array. | Array[File] |
| i1_fastq | Optional array of i1 (index) FASTQ files; index reads used for demultiplexing of multiple samples on one flow cell. | Array[File] | 
| input_id | Unique identifier describing the biological sample or replicate that corresponds with the FASTQ files; inserted into read group header and used to name output files. | String |
| read_structure | Description of the UMI (M) and Barcode (C) positions in the Read 1 FASTQ; used to trim spacer sequences (X) for use by STARsolo; ex. "8C18X6C9M1X". | String |

#### Pseudogene handling

The example Slide-seq reference files are created using the [BuildIndices pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/build_indices/BuildIndices.wdl). The BuildIndices pipeline modifies a given GTF downloaded from GENCODE to only include biotypes that are listed in a tab separated file ([biotypes.tsv](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/dockers/skylab/snss2-build-indices/Biotypes.tsv)). The example references do not include the pseudogene biotype. Learn more about Ensembl biotypes in the [Ensembl overview](https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html).

#### Sample inputs for analyses in a Terra Workspace

The Slide-seq pipeline is currently available on the cloud-based platform Terra. After registering, you can access the [Slide-seq public workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/warp-pipelines/Slide-seq) which is preloaded with instructions and sample data. Please view the [Support Center](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us) for more information on using the Terra platform.

## Slide-seq tasks and tools

The [Slide-seq workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/pipelines/skylab/slideseq/SlideSeq.wdl) imports individual "tasks," also written in WDL script, from the WARP [tasks folder](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/develop/tasks/skylab). 

Overall, the Slide-seq workflow:
1. Calculates prealignment metrics.
1. Uses sctools to filter, trim, and split reads into < 30 GB FASTQs.
1. Uses STARsolo to correct bead barcodes, align reads, and count genes.
1. Calculates metrics.
1. Merges the STAR outputs into NPY and NPZ arrays.
1. Merges gene counts and metrics into a Loom-formatted matrix.

The tools each Slide-seq task employs are detailed in the table below. 

To see specific tool parameters, select the task WDL link in the table; then find the task and view the `command {}` section of the task in the WDL script. To view or use the exact tool software, see the task's Docker image which is specified in the task WDL `# runtime values` section as `String docker =`.

#### 1. Calculating prealignment metrics
The [FastqMetricsSlideSeq](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/FastqProcessing.wdl) task calculates prealignment metrics used for assessing data quality from the input FASTQ files. These metrics include the bead barcode distribution,  UMI distribution, number of reads per cell and number of UMIs per cell. These metrics are included in the final outputs of the workflow. 

#### 2. Filtering reads, trimming barcodes, and splitting FASTQs with sctools

**Read filtering**

Although the function of the bead barcodes is to identify the spatial location of gene expression in the tissue, barcode errors can arise during sequencing that make it difficult to assign reads to the proper location. 

The [FastqProcessingSlidSeq](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/FastqProcessing.wdl) task uses [warp-tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools) to evaluate barcode errors by comparing the Read 1 FASTQ sequences against a whitelist of barcodes created by sequencing prior to the mRNA transfer and library preparation steps of the [Slide-Seq](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1219) protocol.

Barcodes that are more than one edit distance ([Hamming distance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410656/)) from any of the barcode sequences in the whitelist are filtered at this step and not included in the output. The remaining barcodes are corrected by the [STARsoloFastqSlideSeq](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/StarAlign.wdl) task.

**Barcode trimming**

The task uses sctools to trim spacer sequences from bead barcodes and UMIs for use by STARsolo, which requires continuous sample barcodes without spacer sequences between them. The input `read_structure` is used to parse the barcodes and remove any bases with tags other than C or M, which represent the bead barcode and UMI, respectively. For example, with a `read_structure` of 8C18X6C9M1X, bases represented by 18X and 1X are removed from the reads and the string of bases is rewritten with the structure 14C9M. Bases represented by tags other than X will also be removed during this step, so long as they are not C or M.

**FASTQ splitting**

For faster processing of large datasets, the task divides the input array of FASTQ files into multiple FASTQs, each containing reads from the same bead barcodes such that the FASTQ files are approximately 30 GB in size. 

#### 3. Correcting bead barcodes, trimming and aligning reads, and counting genes with STARsolo

**Bead barcode correction**

The [STARsoloFastqSlideSeq](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/StarAlign.wdl) task uses the STAR aligner to evaluate barcode errors by comparing the Read 1 FASTQ sequences against a whitelist of barcodes created by sequencing prior to the mRNA transfer and library preparation steps of the [Slide-seq](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1219) protocol.

Corrected barcodes are those that fall within one edit distance ([Hamming distance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410656/)) of one of the barcode sequences in the whitelist. Note that prior to running STARsolo, uncorrectable barcodes (with more than one mismatch) are filtered out by the [FastqProcessingSlidSeq](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/FastqProcessing.wdl) task.

**Read trimming**

Poly(A) tails are trimmed from reads using the STARsolo parameter `--clip3pAdapterSeq AAAAAA`.

**Alignment**

STAR maps barcoded reads to the genome primary assembly reference (see the [Quickstart table](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Slide-seq_Pipeline/README#quickstart-table) above for version information). The example references for the Slide-seq workflow were generated using the [BuildIndices pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/pipelines/skylab/build_indices/BuildIndices.wdl).

**Gene annotation and counting**

Prior to gene counting, STARsolo adds gene annotations which will vary depending on the value of `count_exons`. By default, `count_exons` is true and STARsolo will run with the parameter `--soloFeatures Gene GeneFull` to produce both whole-gene and exon counts. If `count_exons` is false, STARsolo will run with the parameter `--soloFeatures GeneFull` to produce whole-gene counts.

The resulting BAM files are merged together into a single BAM using the [MergeSortBamFiles](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/MergeSortBam.wdl) task.

**STARsolo outputs**

The task’s output includes a coordinate-sorted BAM file containing the bead barcode-corrected reads and SAM attributes UB UR UY CR CB CY NH GX GN. Additionally, after counting, the task outputs three intermediate TSV files (features, barcodes, and matrix) used for downstream Loom matrix generation.   

#### 4. Calculating metrics

The [CalculateGeneMetrics](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/Metrics.wdl), [CalculateUMIsMetrics](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/master/skylab/Metrics.wdl), and [CalculateCellMetrics](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/Metrics.wdl) tasks use [warp-tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp-tools) to calculate summary metrics that help assess the per-bead and per-UMI quality of the data output each time this pipeline is run. 

These metrics output from both tasks are included in the output Loom matrix. A detailed list of these metrics is found in the [Slide-seq Count Matrix Overview](./count-matrix-overview.md).

#### 5. Merging the STAR outputs into NPY and NPZ arrays

The STARsolo output includes a features, barcodes, and matrix TSV for each of the partitioned FASTQ input files. The [MergeStarOutput task](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/StarAlign.wdl) merges each respective TSV. It uses a custom python script to convert the merged matrix, features, and barcodes output from STARsolo into an NPY (features and barcodes)- and NPZ (the matrix)-formatted file.

#### 6. Merging counts and metrics data into Loom-formatted matrix

The [SingleNucleusOptimusLoomOutput](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/master/tasks/skylab/LoomUtils.wdl) task uses a custom python script to merge the converted STARsolo count matrix and the cell (bead) and gene metrics into a Loom-formatted bead-by-gene matrix. **These counts are raw and unfiltered.**

Read full details for all the metrics in the [Slide-seq Count Matrix Overview](./count-matrix-overview.md).

**Gene counts**

The type of gene counts in the Loom will vary depending on the value of the Slide-seq workflow input, `count_exons`. By default, `count_exons` is set to true and the output Loom will contain whole-gene counts with exon counts in an additional layer.

If the workflow is run with `count_exons` set to false, the output Loom file will contain whole-gene counts. Running the workflow in this configuration will cause the Loom matrix to have fewer columns (bead barcodes) due to the difference in STARsolo counting mode.

You can determine which type of counts are in the Loom by looking at the global attribute `expression_data_type`.

After running the pipeline with `count_exons` set to true, you can access whole-gene and exonic counts using Loompy's `layers()` method. For example, `loompy.connect.layers[“”]` will return the whole-gene counts from the output Loom file. Similarly, `loompy.connect.layers[“exon_counts”]` will return the exonic counts from the output Loom. 


#### 6. Outputs

Output files of the pipeline include:

1. Bead x Gene unnormalized count matrices in Loom format.
2. Unfiltered, sorted BAM file with barcode and downstream analysis tags.
3. Bead metadata, including bead metrics.
4. Gene metadata, including gene metrics.

The following table lists the output files produced from the pipeline. For samples that have sequenced over multiple lanes, the pipeline will output one merged version of each listed file.
