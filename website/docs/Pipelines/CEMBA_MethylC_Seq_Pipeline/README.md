## Introduction to the CEMBA Workflow

CEMBA is a pipeline developed by the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) that supports the processing of multiplexed single-nuclei bisulfite sequencing data. It is an alignment and methylated base calling pipeline that trims adaptors, attaches cell barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, filters reads based on quality, and creates both a VCF and ALLC file with methylation-site coverage.

# Set-up

## CEMBA Installation and Requirements
The CEMBA pipeline code is written in the [Workflow Description Language (WDL)](https://openwdl.org/) and can be downloaded by cloning the GitHub repository [WARP](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp). For the latest release of CEMBA, please see the release tags prefixed with "CEMBA" [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tags). CEMBA can be deployed using [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell), a GA4GH compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms.

The workflow can also be run on Terra using the [Methyl-c-seq_Pipeline workspace](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/brain-initiative-bcdc/Methyl-c-seq_Pipeline). This workspace contains the CEMBA workflow, workflow configurations, required reference data and other inputs, and demultiplexed example testing data.

## Inputs

CEMBA pipeline inputs are detailed in the example human configuration file ([CEMBA.inputs.json](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/pipelines/cemba/cemba_methylcseq/example_inputs/CEMBA.inputs.json)). Genomic reference files were built using the [BuildCembaReferencesWDL script](https://github.com/BICCN/CEMBA/blob/master/pipelines/build_cemba_references/BuildCembaReferences.wdl). See descriptions of all inputs in the tables below.

### Sample data input

### Prior to running: set-up the workflow for using multiplexed samples

The pipeline uses paired-end reads, but it can only perform multiplexing when running in single-end mode. If you have multiplexed samples and want to attach cell barcodes, you must run the pipeline in single-end mode. If you do not wish to attach cell barcodes, you may run in paired-end mode (even if your samples are multiplexed). You can specify single-end mode or paired-end mode using the paired_end_run boolean in the configuration file. You will also need to adjust the extract_and_attach_barcodes_in_single_end_run boolean to true if you want to attach barcodes.

### 1. Trim adaptors

The CEMBA workflow Trim task uses Cutadapt software to remove the Read1 (R1) and Read2 (R2) adaptor sequences specified in the input configuration from the zipped R1 and R2 FASTQ files. Low-quality reads are trimmed from the 5’ and 3’ ends using the interval specified in the quality_cutoff input parameter.  To avoid empty reads, a threshold for read length is set using the min_length_paired_end_trim option.

### 2. Extract cell barcodes

CEMBA can extract cell barcodes from multiplexed samples if the extract_and_attach_barcodes_in_single_end_run boolean is true and the samples are run in single-end mode. To do this, the workflow uses the CreateUnmappedBam and ExtractCellBarcodes tasks to first make an unaligned BAM (uBAM) for the trimmed R1 FASTQ and then tag barcodes identified with the barcode_white_list input to the uBAM.

### 3. Trim degenerate bases, random primer indexes, and Adaptase C/T tail

After barcode extraction, the Trim task is used a second time to remove additional bases resulting from R1 random primer indexes (often used as barcodes) and the R2 C/T tail introduced by the Adaptase enzyme. Reads are trimmed using the cut_length input. The read length threshold is set by the min_length_single_end input.

### 4. Align to a reference genome

The resulting trimmed FASTQ files can be aligned to a reference either in single-end mode for multiplexed samples or paired-end mode. For all modes, the workflow aligns with Bismark with --bowtie2 option. For paired-end or the single-end mode for R1, the workflow uses a directional option with --pbat parameter. For R2, the directional option is turned off.

### 5. Sort, remove duplicates, and filter

The aligned BAM(s) are scattered and sorted in coordinate order using Picard. Duplicate reads are then removed from the sorted BAM. If a min_map_quality is provided in the input, reads will be filtered accordingly and a BAM produced for all reads above the min_map_quality and a BAM for reads below the min_map_quality.

### 6. Generate methylation reports

Methylation reports are generated using the Bismark at two steps in the workflow: after the removal of duplicates and again after filtering on min_map_quality. The bismark_methylation_extraction function with the -- comprehensive --merge_non_CpG --report options outputs multiple reports which are detailed in the [Bismark documentation](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/Bismark_User_Guide.pdf). These outputs include mbias, splitting, CpG context, and non-CpG context reports.

### 7. Attach barcodes, merge BAMs, add read groups, sort and index BAMs

In the AttachBarcodes task, Picard attaches the barcodes in the R1 uBAM to the aligned, duplicate-removed, and if applicable, filtered, R1 BAM. This produces a tagged_mapped.bam file. Once the barcodes are attached, the MergeBams task uses Samtools to merge the (barcoded if applicable) R1 BAM with the aligned and filtered R2 BAM. Read groups are then attached to the merged BAM file with GATK4 and the BAM is sorted with Picard. The BAM is indexed with Samtools.

### 8. Call methylated bases

Methylated bases are identified using the MethylationTypeCaller task which calls the GATK4 function MethylationTypeCaller. This produces a VCF with methylation calls.

### 9. Create ALLC file
The VCF containing methylation calls is used to create an additional [ALLC ("all-cytosine") file](https://github.com/yupenghe/methylpy#output-format) which can be used for downstream differential methylated regions in downstream analyses.

### 10. Compute coverage depth

The ComputeCoverageDepth task uses Samtools to calculate any region in the filtered, sorted BAM with a coverage depth greater than 1. This interval is read in the stdout of the workflow.
