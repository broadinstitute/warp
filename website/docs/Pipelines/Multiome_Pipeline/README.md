## Introduction to the Multiome workflow

Multiome is an open-source, cloud-optimized pipeline developed in collaboration with members of the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) (BICCN and [BICAN](https://brainblog.nih.gov/brain-blog/brain-issues-suite-funding-opportunities-advance-brain-cell-atlases-through-centers) Sequencing Working Group) and [SCORCH](https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/organization/divisions/division-neuroscience-behavior-dnb/basic-research-hiv-substance-use-disorder/scorch-program) (see [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) below). It supports the processing of 10x 3' single-cell and single-nucleus gene expression (GEX) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data generated with the [10x Genomics Multiome assay](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression).

The workflow is a wrapper WDL script that calls two subworkflows: the [Optimus workflow](../Optimus_Pipeline/README) for single-cell GEX data and the [ATAC workflow](../ATAC/README) for single-cell ATAC data. 

The GEX component corrects cell barcodes (CBs) and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs), aligns reads to the genome, calculates per-barcode and per-gene quality metrics, and produces a raw cell-by-gene count matrix. 

The ATAC component corrects CBs, aligns reads to the genome, calculates per-barcode quality metrics, and produces a fragment file.

The wrapper WDL is available in the WARP repository (see the [code here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/pipelines/skylab/multiome/Multiome.wdl)).

## Set-up

### Multiome installation

To download the latest Multiome release, see the release tags prefixed with "Multiome" on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases). All Multiome pipeline releases are documented in the [Multiome changelog](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/blob/develop/pipelines/skylab/multiome/Multiome.changelog.md). 

To discover and search releases, use the WARP command-line tool [Wreleaser](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/tree/master/wreleaser).

If youâ€™re running a Multiome workflow version prior to the latest release, the accompanying documentation for that release may be downloaded with the source code on the WARP [releases page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases) (see the source code folder).

Multiome can be deployed using [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a GA4GH compliant, flexible workflow management system that supports multiple computing platforms. The workflow can also be run in [Terra](https://app.terra.bio), a cloud-based analysis platform.
