# All of Us Pipelines
This folder contains a public selection of WDL workflows developed for analyzing genomic data from the All of Us Research Program. These workflows are provided for use by the broader research community.

Each workflow resides in its own folder and includes the WDL file, documentation, scripts, and input examples as applicable.
