## Announcement: CEMBA file paths are deprecated 11/05/2024

Since the CEMBA workflow is now deprecated and unsupported, file paths in the JSON file are also no longer supported.

However, CEMBA data is available on the NEMO data portal. The CEMBA documentation is also still available. See [CEMBA Pipeline Overview](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/CEMBA_MethylC_Seq_Pipeline/README) on the [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### CEMBA summary

CEMBA is a pipeline developed by the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) that supports processing of multiplexed single-nuclei bisulfite sequencing data. It is an alignment and methylated base calling pipeline that trims adaptors, attaches cell barcodes, aligns reads to the genome, filters reads based on quality and creates a VCF with methylation-site coverage.
